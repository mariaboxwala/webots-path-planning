# FSM-Based Can Collection Task in Webots

This project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) controller in Webots to simulate a robot that:
- **Detects and collects cans**
- **Returns to a base station**
- Transitions between behaviors based on **sensor input and task completion**

---

## 🤖 Project Overview

A robot is equipped with proximity and camera sensors to explore an arena and locate multiple "can" objects. Once all cans are collected (touched), the robot transitions to seeking a fixed base station location. Upon reaching the base, the robot terminates its operation.

## 🧠 Finite State Machine (FSM)

The robot's behavior is governed by a clear FSM with the following states:

| Current State        | Stimulus                | Next State              |
|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| `Wander`             | Can detected by camera  | `Move forward`          |
| `Wander`             | Obstacle touched        | `Wander`                |
| `Wander`             | All cans found          | `Wander for Base`       |
| `Move forward`       | Obstacle touched        | `Wander`                |
| `Wander for Base`    | Obstacle touched        | `Wander for Base`       |
| `Wander for Base`    | Base detected           | `Move forward to Base`  |
| `Move forward to Base` | Obstacle touched       | `Stop` (Final State)    |

- **Start State**: `Wander`
- **End State**: `Stop`

## ⚙️ Implementation Highlights

- Uses a **Boolean array** to track which cans have been touched
- Implements **back-off + rotate behavior** on obstacle collision
- Employs **vision-based detection** to transition to "can detected" and "base detected" states
- Final transition to `Stop` occurs when base is touched after all cans have been collected

## ▶️ Running the Simulation

1. Open Webots
2. Load the world from the `worlds/` directory
3. Compile and run the simulation using the FSM controller in `controllers/`

---

## ✅ Test Scenarios

Three tests were run with varying robot start orientations and obstacle layouts. All tests completed successfully with the robot:
- Identifying and touching all cans
- Transitioning to base-seeking behavior
- Reaching and stopping at the base

## 🧩 Robotics Concepts Used

- **FSM (Finite State Machine)** for task sequencing
- **Logical sensors** to abstract from physical detection (can/base)
- **Reactive collision handling** for real-world robustness
